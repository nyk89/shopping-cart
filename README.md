# shopping-cart

This program is used to create a list of grocery items that can be input, listed, and totaled for Kelly's Organics grocery store.

## Prerequisites

  + Anaconda 3.7
  + Python 3.7
  + Pip

## Installation

Fork this [remote repository](https://github.com/nyk89/shopping-cart) under your own control, then "clone" or download your remote copy onto your local computer.

Then navigate there from the command line (subsequent commands assume you are running them from the local repository's root directory):

```sh
cd shopping-app
```

Use Anaconda to create and activate a new virtual environment, perhaps called "game-env":

```sh
conda create -n shopping-env python=3.7 # (first time only)
conda activate shopping-env
```
